This is a Login System project which serves functionalities like signup, login and signout. I have used HTML, Bootstap CSS for styling, PHP for server-side scripting, SQL and PHPMyAdmin for maintaining data in the database for this project.

**WEBSITE WORKFLOW:**
1) User will signup on signup.php -> 
2) user will get a username and password -> 
3) data (login credentials) will get stored in database -> 
4) once account is created, user can login securely through login.php -> 
5) after logging in, user will be directed to welcome.php page, if user is not logged in and tries to access welcome page, user will be redirected to login.php -> 
6) finally, user can logout through logout.php 

- Component file names will start with an underscore "_"

- All components(eg - navbar) will be located in a folder called "partials"
